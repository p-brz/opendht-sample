# OpenDHT Example

An example to experiment OpenDHT.

## Build

To build you can use [conan](https://www.conan.io/).

Install it using pip

        pip install conan
        
Then, let conan get all dependencies:

        conan install
        
and now build:

        conan build
        
or

        ./waf configure build
        

## License

Well, since OpenDHT use GPLv3, i think the whole project needs to be lincensed under GPLv3 also, right?

Otherwise, assume it is under the MIT terms and be happy.
